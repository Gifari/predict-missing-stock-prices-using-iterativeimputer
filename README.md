# Predict Missing Stock Prices Using IterativeImputer
###  Replacing past history stock prices with NaN and then using sklearn's IterativeImputer to guess what value it was. An addition to my Medium article.

I've created this notebook after writing my Medium article. [Click here](https://gifari.medium.com/a-better-way-to-handle-missing-values-in-your-dataset-using-iterativeimputer-9e6e84857d98) to read my Medium article, where I go more indepth on this topic.<br><br>
This notebook was developed on Kaggle as a tutorial for another use case of scikit-learn's [IterativeImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.IterativeImputer.html).<br><br>
This script uses historical stock market data obtained from using the package "yfinance", which was developed by [Ran Aroussi](https://aroussi.com/). To view the documentation, [click here](https://aroussi.com/post/python-yahoo-finance).
